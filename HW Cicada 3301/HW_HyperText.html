    <h1>Cicada 3301</h1>
    <p>
        <b color='blue'>Cicada 3301</b> is a nickname given to an alleged enigmatic organization that posted three sets of puzzles online between <i color = 'blue'>2012</i> and <i color = 'blue'>2014</i>. <br> 
       The first Internet puzzle started on <i color = 'blue'>January 4, 2012</i>, on 4chan and ran for nearly a month. A second round began one year later on <i color = 'blue'>January 4, 2013</i>, and then a third round following the confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on <i color = 'blue'>January 4, 2014</i>.The third puzzle has yet to be solved. The stated intent was to recruit <q>individuals</q> by presenting a series of puzzles which were to be solved. No new puzzles were published on <i>January 4, 2015 </i>. However, a new clue was posted on Twitter on <i>January 5, 2016</i>.<b> Cicada 3301</b> posted their last verified PGP-signed message in April 2017, denying the validity of any unsigned puzzle.The puzzles focused heavily on data security, cryptography, steganography, and internet anonymity.
       It has been called <q>the most elaborate and mysterious puzzle of the internet age</q> and is listed as one of the <q>top 5 eeriest, unsolved mysteries of the internet</q>by The Washington Post, and much speculation exists as to its function. Many have speculated that the puzzles are a recruitment tool for the NSA, CIA, MI6, a <q>Masonic conspiracy</q> or a cyber mercenary group. Others have claimed Cicada 3301 is an alternate reality game, although no company or individual has attempted to monetize it.

    <h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>
        The stated purpose of the puzzles each year was to recruit "highly intelligent individuals", although the ultimate purpose remains unknown. <br>
        Some claimed that Cicada 3301 is a secret society with the goal of improving cryptography, privacy and anonymity. Others claimed that Cicada 3301 is a cult or religion. According to statements of several people who won the 2012 puzzle, 3301 typically uses non-puzzle-based recruiting methods, but created the Cicada puzzles because they were looking for potential members with cryptography and computer security skills.
    </p>
    <h1>Types of clues</h1>
    <p>
        The Cicada 3301 clues spanned many different forms of communication media, including the internet, telephone, original music, bootable Linux CDs, digital images, physical paper signs, and pages of unpublished cryptic books written in runes. One book, titled Liber Primus, literally "first book", contains many pages, only some of which have been decrypted. More information on which pages were solved, and how can be found on the official Cicada 3301 wiki. In addition to using many varying techniques to encrypt, encode, or hide data, these clues also referenced a wide variety of books, poetry, artwork and music. Each clue was signed by the same OpenPGP private key to confirm authenticity

    <h1>First puzzle </h1>
    <p>
        The first puzzle, of 2012, was solved by Marcus Wanner. According to him, those who solved the puzzles were asked questions about their support of information freedom, online privacy and freedom, and rejection of censorship. Those who answered satisfactorily at this stage were invited to a private forum, where they were instructed to devise and complete a project intended to further the ideals of the group.He did not finish his work on a method of general decryption and the website was removed.

    <h1>Hidden cult ?</h1>
    <p>
        As the group gained notoriety and public attention, many asserted that the puzzles were an introduction to occult principles, and possibly even recruitment for a cult. Conspiracy theorist Tim Dailey, a former senior research fellow with the conservative Christian Family Research Council, analyzed Cicada 3301 puzzles and stated, "The enigmatic Cicada 3301 appears to be drawing participants inexorably into the dark web of the occult Ã  la Blavatsky and Crowley. At the heart of the enchantment is the counterfeit promise of ultimate meaning through self-divination."
        Others claimed that the Cicada 3301 puzzles are a modern and technological equivalent to the enlightenment journey within Western esotericism and mystery schools
